# Java Comparator

Once the OOXML files are converted to JSON files by the Data Parser, They are treated as the input for the JAVA Comparator.

Java Comparator takes in Folder for each of the OOXML files converted, loads the necessary JSON, and Generates the Report and Diffs to given path.

## Setup and Usage

Once the Dataparser has been run on Folders containing the OOXML files, We now have two generated folders containing all the Folders for all OOXML for their respective types. The Java Comparator takes the Path to these folders as input through a config file.

To prepare the input, a config file looks something like this.

```bash
path/to/the/original/files/generated/folder
path/to/the/roundtripped/files/generated/folder
path/to/the/output/folder
```
The Generated folders are created by Data Parser. in the folder containing the original files itselt. If they are not present, please check the exec_log.txt file generated by the Data Parser for the path.

Save the above shown 3 path line in a file, like 'comparator.config'.

Now to run the comparator on the files, execute the following:

```bash
javac ./javacomparator/*.java
java RunComparator ./javacomparator/comparator.config
```

This will run the comparator and produce various reports in the output path provided in the Config File. If not, please check the Status log Created.
