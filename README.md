## OOXML COMPARATOR - Intern Project 2020

Whenever an Office file is imported into Google docs and exported back, there are significant differences between the OOXML of the original document and the exported document. It would be helpful to compare the OOXMLs of the two documents so as to understand the similarities and differences.


The OOXML Comparator can be a standalone script/project that can take an input of original Office files and roundtripped files (imported/exported in Docs) and compare all the OOXML between those and provide the differences in them.
